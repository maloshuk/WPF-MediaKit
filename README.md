#!!!FORK!!!  WPF MediaKit


Fork of WPF MediaKit (https://github.com/Sascha-L/WPF-MediaKit)!

What's changed in version 2.0?
- EVR Presenter uses DXVA2 hardware acceleration (thanks to Siegfried Krüger!)
- EVR Presenter doesn't require the DirectX  March 2009 Runtimes anymore (thanks to Siegfried Krüger!)
- DirectShow graph will be built manually to have full control
- Options to set the desired Video, Audio and Splitter Codecs

Many thanks to Jeremiah Morrill who originally created and developed this awesome control!

**There is still a lot to do! So please feel free to help, if you are an advanced developer! :-)**
